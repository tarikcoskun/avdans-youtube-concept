### ü§ù Contributing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The project is still not in the state where I want it to be and I will most likely be making many commits until it is, so you might not want to contribute at the current state of the project as it would be really hard for you to track the changes I made and apply into your changes.

Pull requests are welcome. Issues are preffered for advices or new ideas. Please test your changes before opening pull requests.

### üì¶Ô∏è Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is required for this project to run. Node.js natively comes with npm, but I recommend using yarn over it, as it is faster. You can install yarn in your machine by using `npm install yarn -g` command.

- Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
- Start the project:
  - in development mode: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`,
  - in production mode: First, run `yarn build` or `npm run build` then run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve`.
