### 📦️ Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is required for this project to run. Node.js natively comes with npm, but I recommend using yarn over it, as it is faster. You can install yarn in your machine by using `npm install yarn -g` command.

- Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
- Start the project:
  - in development mode: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`,
  - in production mode: First, run `yarn build` or `npm run build` then run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve`.
